"<p>As your app grows, visual rhythm matters as much as feature scope.</p>\n<p>Use larger feature cards to call attention to primary content, then support with\nsmaller cards for secondary updates.</p>\n<h2>Practical layout pattern</h2>\n<p>Use one featured card followed by standard cards in a responsive grid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>lg:col-span-2</code> for the featured story</li>\n<li>regular span for supporting posts</li>\n<li>consistent card media height below <code>lg</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That gives you hierarchy without reinventing every breakpoint.</p>\n<h3>A quick spacing rule</h3>\n<p>Pair spacing in steps of 4 (<code>p-4</code>, <code>p-8</code>, <code>gap-4</code>, <code>gap-8</code>) and only break that\nrule for hero sections.</p>\n<h2>Card hierarchy recipe</h2>\n<p>For content-heavy indexes, this sequence works well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One featured card with expanded width</li>\n<li>Three to six standard cards for breadth</li>\n<li>Optional utility card for onboarding links</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep title sizes mostly consistent and let width + image treatment carry\nhierarchy. That avoids jarring jumps as breakpoints shift.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding layout drift</h3>\n<p>If cards start to look uneven, check image heights first, then paragraph length.\nConsistency there usually fixes 80% of visual noise.</p>"
